A comprehensive Deep Reinforcement Learning solution for optimizing electric bus fleet scheduling with multiple state-of-the-art on-policy & off-policy algorithms. This project implements and compares four different RL approaches: **PPO**, **DDQN**, **REINFORCE**, and **A2C** for solving the electric bus scheduling problem.

## Project Lineage

This repository is inherited from the original project:
- Source: [https://github.com/meghkc/RL-ESB](https://github.com/meghkc/RL-ESB)

The original codebase provides the baseline RL environment, agents, and training scripts for a synthetic electric bus scheduling setup.

## What Changed In This Repo

This fork extends the original project with dataset-driven scheduling support and related training updates:

- Added `dataArticleJuliette/` support (Montreal transit benchmark instance format from here https://www.gerad.ca/%7eguyd/mdevsp.html).
- Added `dataset_loader.py` to parse `depots.txt`, `recharge.txt`, `voyages.txt`, and `hlp.txt`.
- Updated `environment.py` to support both:
  - `synthetic` mode (original config-based setup), and
  - `juliette` mode (instance files from `dataArticleJuliette`).
- Updated `run.py` with CLI options for dataset selection:
  - `--data-source`, `--dataset-root`, `--dataset-subset`, `--dataset-split`, `--dataset-instance`.
- Updated PPO flow (`run.py`, `ppo_agent.py`) to use environment-provided valid actions and dynamic state/action dimensions.
- Updated setup notes so only core PyTorch is required by default (no mandatory `torchvision`/`torchaudio`).

Added dataset CLI support so PPO can run on a specific Juliette instance (e.g., python run.py --data-source juliette --dataset-root dataArticleJuliette --dataset-subset A --dataset-split Training --dataset-instance Network9a_22_0).

### Simulator Environment with Juliette Dataset

#### Overview

The core class is `BusSchedulingEnv` in `environment.py`. It models a **sequential assignment problem**: at each step, the agent assigns one of the available buses to the next trip in the timetable (sorted by departure time).

> **Note:** This is a planning/scheduling task, not real-time control. The full timetable is known upfront and the environment is fully deterministic — the agent learns a constructive heuristic that generalizes across problem instances.

#### Observations

Observation vector dimension: `2 + num_buses`

| Index | Meaning | Normalization |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `[0]` | Current trip departure time | `(event_time - op_start) / t_range` → [0, 1] |
| `[1]` | Bus line ID of the current trip | `(line_idx - 1) / (num_lines - 1)` → [0, 1] |
| `[2..2+N]` | Per-bus readiness for each of the N buses | `(event_time - (bus.next_available_time + deadhead_to_trip)) / t_range` |

The per-bus readiness is the key signal: **positive** means the bus is available at the trip's origin on time; **negative** means it would arrive late (infeasible without penalty).

#### How Each Step / Decision Point Is Determined

Each environment step corresponds to exactly one trip event from the timetable:

1. Trips are sorted by `(departure_time, line_id)`.
2. `current_index` points to the next trip to assign.
3. The agent chooses one bus for that trip.
4. The environment updates that bus state (`location`, `next_available_time`, `used`) and increments `current_index`.
5. Episode ends when all trips are assigned.

This means the decision is made at each trip's scheduled departure event (offline planning, not real-time dispatch).

#### Actions (What Are Actions?)

- Action space is discrete: `action in {0, 1, ..., num_buses - 1}`.
- The selected action is the bus ID assigned to the current trip.
- Valid-action masking is based on readiness:
  `bus.next_available_time + deadhead_time_to_trip <= trip.departure_time`.
- If no bus is feasible, all actions are temporarily allowed and an unavailability penalty is applied when needed.

#### Reward (How Reward Is Defined)

Per step reward in `environment.py`:

`step_reward = -(W_UNUSED_PENALTY * rn + W_DEADHEAD * deadhead_cost + penalty_unavail) + W_REST_REWARD * rk + chain_bonus`

Where:
- `deadhead_cost`: normalized empty-move cost to reach the trip origin.
- `penalty_unavail`: `W_UNAVAILABILITY` if chosen bus cannot arrive by departure time; else `0`.
- `rn`: `1` when selecting a new bus while at least one already-used bus could serve on time; else `0`.
- `rk`: `1` when reusing an already-used bus that can serve on time; else `0`.
- `chain_bonus`: `W_CHAIN` when the chosen bus's previous trip is on the same line; else `0`.

Terminal reward at the end of episode:
- `step_reward += -W_FINAL * num_used_buses`

#### Juliette Dataset Files

Four files are parsed by `dataset_loader.py`:

| File | Content | Used For |
|------|---------|---------|
| `depots.txt` | `depot_node; num_buses` | Initial bus locations |
| `voyages.txt` | `trip_id; from_node; dep_time; to_node; arr_time; line_id` | Timetable of trips to schedule |
| `hlp.txt` | `from_node; to_node; travel_time` (precomputed shortest paths) | Deadhead travel times between nodes |
| `recharge.txt` | Charging station locations | Loaded but not yet factored into reward |

By subset:

| Subset | Instances | Avg services | Services min-max | Avg lines | Avg depots |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| A | 500 | 686.41 | 568-893 | 8.0 | 1.0 |
| B | 500 | 686.41 | 568-893 | 8.0 | 1.0 |
| C | 500 | 686.41 | 568-893 | 8.0 | 2.0 |
| D | 500 | 686.41 | 568-893 | 8.0 | 1.0 |
| E | 500 | 786.71 | 669-880 | 20.0 | 2.0 |
| F | 200 | 1335.59 | 1152-1474 | 20.0 | 2.0 |
| G | 50 | 2600.38 | 2374-3115 | 20.0 | - |

All times are in **minutes from start of day**.

#### Travel Times

The simulator is **fully deterministic** — no stochasticity of any kind:

- **Scheduled trip durations** come directly from `voyages.txt` (arrival − departure). Always fixed.
- **Deadhead times** are precomputed shortest-path lookups from `hlp.txt`. The same origin → destination pair always yields the same travel time.
- No Gaussian noise, delay distributions, or traffic perturbations are applied.
