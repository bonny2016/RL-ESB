A comprehensive Deep Reinforcement Learning solution for optimizing electric bus fleet scheduling with multiple state-of-the-art on-policy & off-policy algorithms. This project implements and compares four different RL approaches: **PPO**, **DDQN**, **REINFORCE**, and **A2C** for solving the electric bus scheduling problem.

## Project Lineage

This repository is inherited from the original project:
- Source: [https://github.com/meghkc/RL-ESB](https://github.com/meghkc/RL-ESB)

The original codebase provides the baseline RL environment, agents, and training scripts for a synthetic electric bus scheduling setup.

## What Changed In This Repo

This fork extends the original project with dataset-driven scheduling support and related training updates:

- Added `dataArticleJuliette/` support (Montreal transit benchmark instance format from here https://www.gerad.ca/%7eguyd/mdevsp.html).
- Added `dataset_loader.py` to parse `depots.txt`, `recharge.txt`, `voyages.txt`, and `hlp.txt`.
- Updated `environment.py` to support both:
  - `synthetic` mode (original config-based setup), and
  - `juliette` mode (instance files from `dataArticleJuliette`).
- Updated `run.py` with CLI options for dataset selection:
  - `--data-source`, `--dataset-root`, `--dataset-subset`, `--dataset-split`, `--dataset-instance`.
- Updated PPO flow (`run.py`, `ppo_agent.py`) to use environment-provided valid actions and dynamic state/action dimensions.
- Updated setup notes so only core PyTorch is required by default (no mandatory `torchvision`/`torchaudio`).

Added dataset CLI support so PPO can run on a specific Juliette instance (e.g., python run.py --data-source juliette --dataset-root dataArticleJuliette --dataset-subset A --dataset-split Training --dataset-instance Network9a_22_0).

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

- **Bus Lines**: Multiple bus routes with different terminals and schedules
- **Operation Parameters**: Operating hours (6 AM - 9 PM), trip times, rest periods
- **Fleet Settings**: Number of available buses, depot configuration
- **Reward Weights**: Deadhead costs, unused bus penalties, chain bonuses
- **Algorithm Hyperparameters**: Learning rates, network architectures, training episodes

## Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Type | Key Features | Best For |
|-----------|------|--------------|----------|
| **PPO** | Policy Gradient | Stable, clipped updates | General purpose, stable training |
| **DDQN** | Value-based | Experience replay, target network | Sample efficiency, discrete actions |
| **REINFORCE** | Policy Gradient | Simple, direct optimization | Understanding baselines |
| **A2C** | Actor-Critic | Advantage estimation, shared features | Reduced variance, faster convergence |

## Results

The system learns to:
- **Minimize Fleet Size**: Use fewer buses while meeting all trip demands
- **Optimize Scheduling**: Reduce deadhead movements between terminals  
- **Create Efficient Chains**: Assign consecutive trips to same buses on same lines
- **Handle Constraints**: Respect bus availability and time windows
- **Balance Trade-offs**: Fleet size vs. operational efficiency

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Reward**: Overall system performance
- **Buses Used**: Fleet efficiency (typically 3-5 buses from 10 available)
- **Training Stability**: Convergence speed and consistency
- **Solution Quality**: Meeting all trip demands with minimal resources

## Technical Details

### Problem Definition
- **3 Bus Lines**: Different terminals (Terminal1, Terminal2, Terminal3) with varying schedules
- **Operation Period**: 15-hour daily operation (6:00 AM - 9:00 PM)
- **Fleet Management**: 10 available buses, minimize actual usage
- **Scheduling Constraints**: Bus availability, terminal locations, trip timing

### Environment State Space
- **Time Information**: Normalized current event time and bus line ID
- **Bus Status**: Availability times for each bus (positive = available, negative = busy)
- **Location Tracking**: Current terminal positions for deadhead cost calculation

### Action Space
- **Bus Assignment**: Select which bus (0-9) to assign to each trip
- **Action Masking**: Only available buses can be selected
- **Constraint Handling**: Automatic filtering of invalid assignments

### Reward Function Components
- **Deadhead Cost**: Penalty for moving empty buses between terminals
- **Unused Bus Penalty**: Discourage using new buses when used buses are available  
- **Rest Reward**: Bonus for reusing available buses
- **Chain Bonus**: Extra reward for consecutive trips on same line
- **Final Penalty**: Total fleet size minimization at episode end
